#include <iostream>

// WIP

// Queue c++ implementation with linked lists

// Queues are FIFO data structures
// (First-in-first-out) useful for scheduling
// and holding items prior to processing

// examples: cpu process management,
// task scheduling, Breadth first search, data transfer

// basic operations:
//  enqueueing (push)
//  dequeueing (pop)

// This is where the usage of linked lists
// becomes necessary, as popping would require 
// rearranging an entire array

// time complexity for linked lists: O(1)
